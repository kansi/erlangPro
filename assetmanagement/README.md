Assetmanagement Portal
=========
This folder contains an asset management portal, that can
be used to manage assets ( like laptops, tablets, cables etc. )
which are owned by a company and used by its employees for various
development and testing purposes. This portal keeps a track of which
resources are issued to which employee on what day and in what state
was the asset.

The portal has been written to use mnesia as backend database and yaws
as webserver.
